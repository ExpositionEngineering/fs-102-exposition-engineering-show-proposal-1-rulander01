## üéâ Show Description

This episode would start out talking to Alice Deckert about her current position at Allegheny College. She is a repected professor and continuing to perform chemical reaserch in the feild of analitical chemistry on campus. Getting to know a potential carrer path that can be taken with the chem major and find out some fun stories of what makes reaserch so interesting- how often it goes wrong! This is just part of the process so perhaps she will have some good stories of when things didnt go quite as planned and then delve into how they were fixed.

After going over a bit about what she does now, i want to find out why she majored in Chemistry in the first place. What were her initial thoughts on what she wanted to do in life, what majors that would be associated with, why she ultimately choose chemsitry. Did family members contribute to this decision and what life experience made her lean in this direction are some more questions I would like to explore. 

To help determine if a major feels like the right fit, many people want to know if the feild their major would take them into is a good environment for them. As a women in Chemistry, I want to know if Deckert has felt as if the feild of chemistry is that she feels comfortable in. Woman have made so many important discoveries in chemistry and it would be incredibly useful to gain insight into if this is a feild that still holds bias agianst certain groups, or holds unfair policies.

As someone who has been succesful after pursuing this major we will explore any and all advise that Deckert wish she knew as a college freshman. This should be a wildly useful segment of the episode for both those who are trying to choose a major and those who are planned chem majors since this will be questioned both broadly for all freshmen trying to make their way through their first year of college and those of this major who will hopefully avoid any academic or otherwise mistakes discussed. Part of what makes humans so "smart" is being able to learn from the mistakes and successes of others who have been through similar experiences. This segment will hopefully help myself and everyone listening to have an easier time in the major by avoiding those mistakes. 
  

## üì¢ Call to Action

After listening to an episode, I want students to better understand the feild of chemstry and have enough information to further research the feild and major themselves. Alternatively, to even see if it is an enviroment they are still interested in.
