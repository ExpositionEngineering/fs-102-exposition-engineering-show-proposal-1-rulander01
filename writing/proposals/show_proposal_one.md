## üéâ Show Description

This episode would start out talking to Alice Deckert about her current position at Allegheny College. She is a respected professor and continuing to perform chemical research in the field of analytical chemistry on campus. Getting to know a potential career path that can be taken with the chem major and find out some fun stories of what makes research so interesting- how often it goes wrong! This is just part of the process so perhaps she will have some good stories of when things didn‚Äôt go quite as planned and then delve into how they were fixed.

After going over a bit about what she does now, I want to find out why she majored in Chemistry in the first place. What were her initial thoughts on what she wanted to do in life, what majors that would be associated with, why she ultimately chose chemistry. Did family members contribute to this decision and what life experience made her lean in this direction are some more questions I would like to explore. 

To help determine if a major feels like the right fit, many people want to know if the field their major would take them into is a good environment for them. As a woman in Chemistry, I want to know if Deckert has felt as if the field of chemistry is one that she feels comfortable in. Woman have made so many important discoveries in chemistry and it would be incredibly useful to gain insight into if this is a field that still holds bias against certain groups and maintains unfair policies.

As someone who has been successful after pursuing this major, we will explore any and all advise that Deckert wishes she had as a college freshman. This should be a wildly useful segment of the episode for both those who are trying to choose a major and those who are planned chem majors since this will be questioned both broadly for all freshmen trying to make their way through their first year of college and those going into this major. Part of what makes humans so "smart" is being able to learn from the mistakes and successes of others who have been through similar experiences. This segment will hopefully help myself and everyone listening to have an easier time in the major by avoiding those mistakes. 
  
## üì¢ Call to Action

After listening to an episode, I want students to better understand the field of chemistry and have enough information to further research the field and major themselves. Alternatively, to even see if it is an environment they are still interested in.
